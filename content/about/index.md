## Hi, I’m Agathe

I’m a curious UX junior who loves where **graphic design, art, and technology** meet. What truly motivates me is contributing to projects that **help people in meaningful ways,** not just making things look good, but making them work better for humans.

## My Journey

My path into the digital world started with a **CFC in Mediamatics**. I then wanted to dig deeper into the technical and strategic side of projects, I continued with a **Bachelor’s in Media Engineering**, where I learned how to manage a digital product from idea to delivery.

Along the way, I discovered **UX Design** as the perfect balance between business needs, technology, and human-centered thinking. That’s where I chose to specialise.

This is a snapshot of what drives me: **Curiosity, creativity, people, and digital experiences that make life a little easier.**

## How This Site Was Built

This website was created with **Hugo**, a simple and fast **Static Site Generator (SSG)**.

I used the **Mana theme**, which I customised using the theme documentation and a bit of help from **GitHub Copilot** (since I don’t have a background in Go).

For publishing, the site runs on **GitHub Pages** with a **GitHub Action** set up for continuous deployment.

All articles are written by me, with a little help from **AI for proofreading and clarity**.
