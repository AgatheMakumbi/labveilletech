## How to (Smartly) Use LLMs to Learn UX

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become almost irresistible tools for learning. They’re getting smarter, more specialised, and more helpful, delivering better results and empowering education. Yet, concerns are growing about dependency and the fear that LLMs might replace our own mental effort.

In this article, I’d like to share my thoughts on how to use LLMs to learn about UX, and what to keep in mind when doing so.

## Understanding AI and LLMs

>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained to understand and generate text in natural language. (MIKA 2025)

 LLMs learn patterns in text (for example, an article) and generate language by predicting the next word based on those patterns. It’s important to keep this in mind: **an LLM doesn’t *know* things, it predicts based on statistical patterns, not understanding.**

Which brings me to my next point...

## Choosing the Right LLM

While it’s often difficult to know exactly what data these models are trained on, since many companies aren’t transparent, it can be useful to research which LLMs perform best in your field and why.

In my case, I discovered **Perplexity** while listening to an online conference where Jakob Nielsen discussed using AI in UX. I’ve found it particularly effective for UX research, proofreading my test scripts and surveys to avoid misunderstandings. Of course, the choice will depend on which model you feel most comfortable using.

## Using LLMs with the Right Intention

LLMs can do a lot for you, but if you’re not careful, they can easily take over your thinking. When learning, it’s crucial to see LLMs as **tools to spark curiosity**, not replace it. They should encourage you to dig deeper into topics, not settle for surface-level answers.

Instead of asking, *“Tell me what UX research is,”* try a richer prompt such as, *“Where can I find good literature on UX research online?”* This provides you with credible references and helps you discover major voices in the field. Think of it like widening your network of knowledge.

Ask the LLM to base its responses on reliable UX sources and to challenge your ideas. Your knowledge grows most when it’s confronted with new perspectives, not when it’s constantly confirmed.

LLMs are also great when you need quick, simplified overviews of complex subjects, a kind of “vulgarisation” tool.

## Using LLMs to Get Feedback

Asking an LLM for feedback on a case study or interview script can be an excellent way to improve your work and learn what to emphasise in your writing. Finding a professional to review your work isn’t always easy, so this approach can save you time and help you refine your UX thinking.

That said, LLMs often lack real-world context. A mentor, for instance, can understand your project’s background, your level of experience, and all the nuances that an AI can’t. LLMs tend to give general advice rather than contextual insight.

UX is best learned by doing, experimenting, and making mistakes. Real-time feedback, such as when a mentor comments on your behaviour during a user interview, is far more meaningful.

A good strategy is to **combine** both: use LLMs for writing feedback and reflection, and a mentor for context-driven, practical advice. This way, you get the analytical precision of the AI and the human understanding of your mentor.

## The Dangers of Overusing LLMs

LLMs come with a number of risks too. One of the biggest is how *addictive* they can be, quick answers are satisfying, and over time, we become less critical of their quality. Without careful fact-checking, it’s easy to slip into passive learning.

Experts are generally better at using LLMs because they can judge whether an answer sounds plausible. They ask sharper questions and set higher expectations. Beginners, on the other hand, often stop at the first response. Never settle for that. Always aim for a broader understanding of your topic so you know what you know, and what you don’t.

## My Experience

Personally, I don’t use LLMs that much for learning about UX itself. I mostly use them to structure or write case studies, design copy, or presentation text, and occasionally to get feedback or grasp a complex topic at a surface level.

Most of my learning still comes from courses, YouTube videos, articles, and books.

However, I sometimes catch myself relying too much on LLMs for tasks like emails or coding, which I’m trying to be more mindful of. Writing these articles on my own has made me realise how much reasoning I was outsourcing to AI, and that over time, it made my language less sharp.

I do believe LLMs are incredible learning tools, but only if we understand **what they are and how they work**. It’s important to remember that your brain will always remain more intelligent, creative, and critical than any model.
