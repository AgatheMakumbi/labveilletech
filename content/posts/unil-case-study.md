# **Sustainable Web Design: A Case Study from the University of Lausanne**

Digital products leave a massive carbon footprint. According to the [**Sustainable Web Manifesto**](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/): “If the Internet was a country, it would be the 4th largest polluter in the world.”

We need a sustainable web. While the need for sustainability has been around for a while, it’s now becoming a standard for digital products. Leading web organisations are providing practical and measurable recommendations for sustainable development, such as the [*Référentiel général d'écoconception de services numériques* (RGESN)](https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-general-ecoconception/) in France, or more recently, the [**W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)**](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-sustainability-guidelines/).

Understanding these principles and being able to approach design projects with a sustainable mindset has become a must-have skill for UX designers.

## The UNIL Digital Team

This mindset is already emerging in many organisations around the world, and many Swiss companies are ahead of the curve. I had the chance to see how the digital team of the University of Lausanne (UNIL) managed to unify and modernise the university’s websites with an eco-friendly approach. The result is remarkable and significantly improves the user experience.

At the start of the project in 2024, the state of UNIL’s websites (which hadn’t been redesigned since 2014) was worrying: over 300 independent sites, no shared communication strategy, confusing navigation between pages, duplicated content, and more than 600 contributors.

All of this negatively affected the experience of the university’s 17,000 students and 5,000 staff members.

## It was time to act

The challenge wasn’t just to redesign the websites, but also to define a new information architecture tailored to each audience, create new content, and put sustainable thinking at the heart of the approach.

The objectives set out helped the team tackle four key challenges in this eco-responsible redesign.

## Restructuring the Information Architecture

The first was the restructuring of the information architecture. By conducting a user survey, the team identified priority user flows and managed to merge 80 independent websites into a single one, reducing the total number of pages by around **66%**.

## Designing a lasting Design System

The second challenge was to design a more sustainable design system by limiting the number of components and defining flexible page templates. This simplification also made the code easier to maintain over time. The result: cleaner pages and stronger visual consistency.

## Reducing Image and Video Impact

Thirdly, the team noticed that 80% of images were used purely for decoration. It took some technical creativity to reduce image weights and data transfers linked to videos.

The compression technique they developed reduced image size by an average of 89%. The team also reconsidered how images contributed to the message on each page.  Video thumbnails were also compressed, and videos now only load once the user starts playback, a method known as lazy loading.

## Applying Best Practices

Finally, the team applied a full range of best web practices to make pages lighter and limit data exchange: using vector font formats (WOFF2), web-optimised image formats (WebP), minimal source code, optimised internal caching, and more.

## A Team Effort Towards Eco-Design

The challenge wasn’t easy, but the team succeeded by clearly defining goals for design and implementation right from the start. The project is the result of many iterations, close collaboration among stakeholders both internal and external, and above all, a genuine desire to learn and explore questions around eco-design.

Teams had to be guided and trained continuously to maintain these principles over time.

Eco-design is now a key skill for designers and developers. This project shows that with a bit of curiosity, willpower, and strong interdisciplinary collaboration, it’s possible to create digital products that delight users and respect the planet.
