## The UX of AI: Patterns and Mental Models

If you're reading this, you're probably tech-curious and familiar with AI chatbots. Actually, these days *everyone* is using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot.

We might love one and get frustrated with another, even when the interfaces look similar. This is where **UX of AI** becomes fascinating  a fresh field that's redefining how we design intelligent systems.



## These Patterns Shape Our Experience

When I started researching, I discovered **tiny interaction patterns** that make or break our AI experience: inputs, suggestions, "stream of thought" responses, attachments, filters, voice & tone...

**Emily Campbell's "The Shape of AI"** is a brilliant resource, it documents 50+ patterns across AI tools, with detailed breakdowns, best practices, and real product examples. It's especially valuable for teams building their own AI-powered products.

## UX Starts When Designing the *Model*

A truly user-centric AI product starts at the **modelling stage**. **Greg Nudelman** (a leading voice in AI UX) explains this perfectly with his **Digital Twin** concept:

> "Digital Twin is simply a digital model of the real world that focuses on modelling the metrics and outcomes that matter most to a physical system. It's an excellent model for UX Design of AI-driven products." (Nudelman, 2025)
> 

**The Digital Twin is a powerful UX tool.**

It's a mental map of the AI product that helps you understand:

- What the system sees/receives
- What it understands
- What it decides and what the user receives.

This makes you think: *"What real-world problem is my AI supposed to improve?"* *"What information does it need to do that?"* *"What output does the user get?"*

These reflections help communicate to users how the AI can help and what its limits are. They also let you define and anticipate **moments of truth** (when the AI or interface messages need to step in).

**Without understanding what your AI perceives, you can't explain:**

- Why it makes certain recommendations
- Why it gets things wrong
- What it completely ignores

## A Rapidly Evolving Field

The literature on this topic is growing steadily (even if it's still quite new). Some say we're entering the era of true intelligence; others think AI is just a passing trend.

Either way, **usages change fast**, and as UX designers, we must keep asking these fundamental questions to build products users *actually need*.
