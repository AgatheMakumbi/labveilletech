## How to Choose the Right Qualitative Research Methods (and Why I Struggle With This)

When starting a UX research project, the methods you pick can really shape the responses you get, and therefore your insights. Figuring out what you actually want to learn, then matching it to the right method, is key. To be honest, I often struggle with this step myself. I found this article super helpful for getting unstuck, so I wanted to share my take on it.

## Align on Depth and Rigor First

Before jumping into methods, ask yourself (and your team/stakeholders):

- How much time do we have?
- What's the risk if we skip research?
- How clear is the problem already?

This helps you decide on the scale, not every project needs deep, rigorous research due to business constraints. I like Jeanette Fuccella's framework for this; it makes trade-offs feel less overwhelming.

## Define Your Research Statement and Goals

Start with a **clear research statement** , a short sentence like: *"Understand how users interact with the current website and spot areas for improvement."* Be specific.

Then set **research goals**, such as:

- Understand user behaviour
- Uncover user needs
- Generate ideas
- Validate assumptions
- Compare designs

These narrow things down fast. For example, if you're redesigning a site, generative goals (discovering needs) point to different methods than evaluative ones (testing usability).

## Generative vs Evaluative Research

**Generative** = explore new ideas/understand users deeply.

**Evaluative** = test if ideas work.

For a website redesign, start generative to find opportunities, then switch to evaluative for usability checks. This choice alone cuts your options in half.

## Generative Methods (for Discovery)

These are great when you're early in the process:

- **1:1 interviews** (up to 90 mins, deep dive with a script)
- **Lightweight intercepts** (quick 5-min chats in the moment)
- **Focus groups** (group discussions for attitudes, fast data collection)
- **Mental model interviews** (map user's journey and needs)
- **Diary studies** (users log thoughts over days/weeks)
- **Participatory/co-design** (users help design with you)
- **Journey map interviews** (trace task steps via talk or observation)
- **Contextual inquiry** (observe users in their real environment)

I love diary studies for seeing behaviour over time , they reveal stuff interviews miss.

## Evaluative Methods (for Testing)

These validate what you've built:

- **Usability testing** (watch users complete tasks, in-person or remote)
- **A/B testing** (compare two versions at scale)
- **Eyetracking** (see where attention goes and where they get stuck)
- **Surveys** (quant data on feelings/products)
- **Heuristic evaluation** (check against UX principles, solo or team)
- **Card sorting** (test info architecture grouping)
- **Benchmarking** (compare metrics to competitors)

Mixed methods work well too, like surveys + follow-up interviews for richer insights.

## From Methods to Insights

Once chosen:

1. **Write open-ended questions** for generative (e.g. "Describe the last time you did [task]"), specific ones for evaluative ("What’s your first impression?").
2. **Collect data**, tools like Typeform for surveys, Zoom/Notably for interviews.
3. **Analyse**, journey maps for navigation data, affinity mapping for themes.
4. **Synthesise**, turn findings into backed-up insights and recommendations.

The method you pick shapes your whole analysis flow.

## My Takeaway

This framework has helped me stop overthinking and just *start*, define goals first, then match methods. Next time you're stuck like I often am, grab the cheat sheet from the original article. It makes choosing feel straightforward.
